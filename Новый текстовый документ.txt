*Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why. Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always learning new things from everywhere etc.).*
3. I will try! 
*Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)*
4. Html+css basics, C# basics 
*Code examples (LATEST)*
5. No, sorry.
*Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses, freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have. Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)*
6. Self-taught.
*Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)*
7. No, sorry.
*English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)*
