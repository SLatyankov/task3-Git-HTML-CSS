    <p class="questions">Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why. Some kind of self-presentation.
    In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You
    shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
    learning new things from everywhere etc.).</p>
     <p>I will try!</p>
    <p class="questions">Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)</p>

    <p> No, sorry.</p>
    <p class="questions">Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses, freelance projects
    - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have. Also it would be awesome if you add links to source
    code)</p>
    <p>Self-taught.</p>
    <p class="questions">Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)</p>
    <p>No, sorry.</p>
