    *Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why. Some kind of self-presentation.
    In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You
    shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
    learning new things from everywhere etc.).*
     <p>I will try!</p>
    *Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)*
    <p> Html+css basics, C# basics</p>
    *Code examples (LATEST)*
    <p> No, sorry.</p>
    *Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses, freelance projects
    - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have. Also it would be awesome if you add links to source
    code)*
    <p>Self-taught.</p>
    *Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)*
    <p>No, sorry.</p>
    *English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)*
    <p>Two weeks of intensive learning.</p></main>
